  <h1>The Page of Projects</h1>
  <p> I'm currently nearing my fourth year in university. I did a full year in
    Bioengineering, then switched courses to Molecular Biology and am just about
    finished with the second year of that programme now. Things here are sorted
    from the most recent at top, with the oldest projects at the bottom.</p>

  <h1>Molecular Biology</h1>
  <p> Mostly essays / mini-literature reviews so far, but some longer-form
    writing and projects should roll around soon!</p>

  <h1>Bioengineering</h1>
  <p> I only did one year on Bioengineering, so there isn't a ton to show off,
  but I've put some of my better things here.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/documents/Histology.pdf">Tissue Who? — A Foray into Histology
	and Tissue Identification</a></li>

  <h1>High School Capstone</h1>
  <p>Hey there! As part of my high school education, all seniors were required
    to complete a Capstone project to showcase their skills and ability to apply
    their knowledge.</p>
  <p>We could complete a project in one of three categories: Research, Buisness,
    or Service. For my project, because I plan on going
    into <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bioengineering/what-is-bioengineering">Bioengineering</a>,
    I chose to do research.</p>
  <p>My research involved designing a detailed experiment (and the genetic
    material needed) for the detection of abitrary DNA sequences within a
    cell. Once the blog component of this website is functional, I'll write more
    about my project. In the meantime, I've linked all of the work I have so
    far.</p>
  <p>The <a href="/documents/HSCapstone.pdf">Capstone Portfolio</a> is a written
    document that contains a bird's-eye view of the Capstone project. It isn't
    specific to the research component; rather, it documents everything from
    college essays to my CV.</p>
  <p>This <a href="/documents/CapstonePoster.pdf">Capstone Poster</a> is much
    more specific to the actual project component of my senior Capstone and
    contains much more detail on how my experiment is designed.</p>
  <p>Here is my <a href="/documents/Materials&Methods.pdf">Materials &
    Methods</a> which includes links to other procedures used for the the more
    technical steps like transformation and the plasmid digests.</p>
  <p>If you are curious about the design of my genetic components, here are
    my <a href="/documents/Plasmids&Oligos.pdf">Plasmids & Oligos</a>. There you
    will find the complete sequences of all my plasmids, inserts, and
    oligos.</p>
