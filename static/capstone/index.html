      <p>Hey there! As part of my high school education, all seniors were required to complete a Capstone project to showcase their skills and ability to apply their knowledge.</p>
      <p>We could complete a project in one of three categories: Research, Buisness, or Service. For my project, because I plan on going into <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/bioengineering/what-is-bioengineering">Bioengineering</a>, I chose to do research.</p>
      <p>My research involved designing a detailed experiment (and the genetic material needed) for the detection of abitrary DNA sequences within a cell. Once the blog component of this website is functional, I'll write more about my project. In the meantime, I've linked all of the work I have so far.</p>
      <p>The <a href="/documents/HSCapstone.pdf">Capstone Portfolio</a> is a written document that contains a bird's-eye view of the Capstone project. It isn't specific to the research component; rather, it documents everything from college essays to my CV.</p>
      <p>This <a href="/documents/CapstonePoster.pdf">Capstone Poster</a> is much more specific to the actual project component of my senior Capstone and contains much more detail on how my experiment is designed.</p>
      <p>Here is my <a href="/documents/Materials&Methods.pdf">Materials & Methods</a> which includes links to other procedures used for the the more technical steps like transformation and the plasmid digests.</p>
      <p>If you are curious about the design of my genetic components, here are my <a href="/documents/Plasmids&Oligos.pdf">Plasmids & Oligos</a>. There you will find the complete sequences of all my plasmids, inserts, and oligos.</p>

      <p>Look forward to more neat things soon!</p>
