<h1>Computer Programming</h1>
<p> Despite not actually pursuing a degree in computer science, I find myself
  doing a lot of hobby-programming. Over the years I've floated a lot between
  different languages and tools. Currently I run Arch Linux and use Emacs to
  write Haskell, Rust, and Common Lisp code. I've worked with plenty of other
  languages, but those three are, by far, my favourites. What can I say? I've
  got a soft spot for functional programming languages.</p>

<p> I primarily code to learn (with the occasional, more practical project), so
  I've got a nasty habit of trying to write things from the ground up. This
  website recently became one of those projects. The whole thing is written
  Framework-Free with minimal dependencies (only a Haskell-Kernel networking
  library at the moment).</p>

<p> Anyhow, you can check out some of my other projects
  on <a href="https://gitlab.com/TheLostLambda">GitLab</a>.</p>
