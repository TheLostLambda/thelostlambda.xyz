<h1>The Landing Page of Brooks J Rady</h1>
<img id="banner" src="/images/logo.svgz">
<p> Hi there! I'm Brooks and I like things. So I've put those things here so
  that I can share them with the Internet. It should be noted that, while this
  website has come a long ways from its original form, it is still under heavy
  development. In the meantime, you'll have to excuse the mess (and send me an
  email / open an issue on GitLab if things go up in flames).</p>

<p> I'm fully aware that this front page is super bland at the moment, but I
  have big plans, so have patience (and dream of Gosper Glider Guns).</p>
